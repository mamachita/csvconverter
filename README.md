# CSV Converter

This node.js script converts CSV downloads from a few Dutch banks (tested with SNS and ASN) to the CSV format [Freeagent accepts](http://www.freeagent.com/support/kb/banking/file-format-for-bank-upload-csv). The new file is saved with "-freeagent" added before the extension.

Usage:

    $ csvconverter.js *.csv

[Freeagent](http://www.freeagent.com) is online accounting software. Recommended for small businesses.
